Run the client program from inside clientfolder and server from the outer folder (shown in typescript mergedscript.txt)
That is, they should run in seperate folders.

I have included the set of files used for my demo in referencefiles folder and the unmerged typescripts of my clients and server in the unmerged_scripts folder.
