Client server socket programming project written in C++ which involves multithreading. Upto five clients can connect with the server (after entering the IP address and port name) to request a file of any type. The server sends back the requested file, with the correct permissions.

The server sends over the file, if it exists in the directory it is currently in.
The client then saves the file in the folder it is currently in (here, the clientfolder).



Various files are requested by the client, and combined typescripts that show the succcessful sending and receiving of these files are contained in the 'mergedscripts' file.
These files are uploaded in the referencefiles folder inside the ADDITIONAL INFO directory. This directory also contains the unmerged typescripts of each instance of the clients requesting the files.


Save these files in the directory of the server executable and then make your clients request for them, if you want to test out the code. They should be successfully saved in the clientfolder. 

The code is pretty well commented, so it's working should be self explanatory. 

Take a look at the typescripts to see how to compile the client and server code!
